## **Introduction**

Machine Learning (ML) is a rapidly growing field with applications in various industries. While there are many powerful libraries available (such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch), implementing algorithms from scratch can provide valuable insights into the inner workings of these techniques.

This repository is designed for educational purposes, aiming to help you understand the core concepts behind popular machine learning algorithms by implementing them step-by-step.

## **Implemented Algorithms**

### **Supervised Learning**
These algorithms learn from labeled data, where the input data is associated with corresponding output labels.

- **Linear Regression** - [Code]()


### **Unsupervised Learning**
These algorithms work with unlabeled data and aim to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.



### **Reinforcement Learning**
These algorithms learn by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties, and improving their actions over time.
